/*
Problem: 835. Image Overlap
Difficulty: Medium
Topic: Matrix, Brute Force, Translation

Approach:
1. Try every possible translation of img1 over img2.
2. For each translation, count how many positions contain 1 in both images.
3. Keep track of the maximum overlap.
4. A translation is represented by shifting rows and columns.
5. No rotation is performed.

Time Complexity: O(n^4)
Space Complexity: O(1)
