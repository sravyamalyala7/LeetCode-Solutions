/*
Problem: 836. Rectangle Overlap
Difficulty: Easy
Topic: Matrix, Geometry

Approach:
1. Check if the two rectangles overlap in the X direction.
2. Check if they overlap in the Y direction.
3. Both directions must overlap for the intersection
   to have a positive area.

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)
